# The JavaScript DOMContentLoaded Event

## Learning Goals

- Understand why `DOMContentLoaded` is important
- Set up an event on `DOMContentLoaded`

## Introduction

An important part of working with JavaScript is ensuring that your code runs at
the right time. Every now and then, you may have to add some extra code to
ensure your code doesn't run before the page is ready. Many factors go into
determining the "right time," but there are two events that represent two
particularly important milestones in terms of page load:

1. The `DOMContentLoaded` event fires when your page's DOM is fully parsed from
   the underlying html
2. The `load` event fires when a resource and all its dependent resources
   (including CSS and JavaScript) have finished loading

In this lesson, we'll be focusing on `DOMContentLoaded`.

## Why is DOMContentLoaded Important?

The `DOMContentLoaded` event is the browser's built-in way to indicate when a
page's html is loaded into the DOM. It isn't possible to manipulate HTML
elements that haven't rendered yet, so trying to manipulate the DOM before the
page fully loads can potentially lead to problems.

We need to make sure to wait until _after_ the `DOMContentLoaded` event is
triggered to safely execute our code. By creating an event listener, we can keep
our code from immediately firing when `index.js` is loaded.

## Set Up an Event Listener for DOMContentLoaded

As always, `addEventListener` takes a `String` with the name of the
event and a _callback function_.

```js
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
  console.log("The DOM has loaded");
});
```

If you put the above code in `index.js`, 'The DOM has loaded' will not be logged
immediately. In fact, you can confirm this yourself by putting a second
`console.log()` _outside_ of the event listener callback:

```js
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
  console.log("The DOM has loaded");
});

console.log(
  "This console.log() fires when index.js loads - before DOMContentLoaded is triggered"
);
```

## Instructions

Code your solution in `index.js`. First, set up a `DOMContentLoaded` event
listener to detect when the HTML page has loaded and the document is ready to be
manipulated. Use the event's callback function to target the paragraph element
with `id="text"` and replace the text with "This is really cool!"

_Note:_ Using the [`innerText`][innertext] property to modify DOM element
content will not work for this lab. Use [`textContent`][textcontent] or
[`innerHTML`][innerhtml] instead.

Test your event in the browser to confirm that it is working.

## DOMContentLoaded Does Not Wait For Stylesheets and Images to Load

It is important to note that the `DOMContentLoaded` event fires once the
initial HTML document finishes loading, but does not wait for CSS stylesheets or
images to load. In situations where you need _everything_ to completely load,
use the `load` event instead.

While both will work, it is often the case that we only need the HTML content to
fully load in order to execute our JavaScript. Since images can take some time
to load, using the `load` event means visitors of a webpage may see your webpage
in its original state for a couple of seconds before any JavaScript fires and
updates the DOM.

For a comparison of the difference between `DOMContentLoaded` and `load`ed
events, [check out this example][eventexample].

## Conclusion

JavaScript provides us the powerful ability to update webpage content without
refreshing. We can, for instance, have a page with some basic HTML structure and
use JavaScript to fill in the content, enabling the possibility of dynamic
webpages.

This sort of action, however, will only work if the HTML content is loaded on
the page before the JavaScript is executed. The `DOMContentLoaded` event ensures
that our JavaScript code is being executed immediately after the HTML is
finished loading.

## Addendum

The `DOMContentLoaded` event is now a widely accepted standard. Modern web
development, however, provides us with additional choices for setting up when we
want our JavaScript to execute. For example, HTML5 now has a [`defer`][defer]
attribute for use in `<script>` tags:

```html
<script src="index.js" defer></script>
```

This functions in a similar way to `DOMContentLoaded`: the JavaScript code
stored in `index.js` will be loaded up but won't execute until the HTML page
completely loads.
