# Stitching Together the Three Pillars

## Learning Goals

- Identify the three essential pillars of front-end web programming
- Cause a change to given code so that DOM updating effect is seen
- Cause a change to given code so that server-side behavior is stubbed in
- Cause a change to given code so that event listening has an effect

## Introduction

Knowing what web programming is and how its elements work together conceptually
is an essential first step, but in order to help orient our upcoming lessons,
let's see it in action. In this lesson we've provided you a simple social media
application called "Simple Liker." You'll see several posts which can be "liked"
by clicking on the heart...well, they _could_ be if the critical code hadn't
been commented out. This lesson will guide you in uncommenting the critical
code so that you restore the "like" functionality. In subsequent lessons, you'll
learn the skills needed to create the pieces that you'll stitch together in this
lesson.

Although this code-along is structured as a lab, you don't need to do anything
to get the tests passing. In fact, if you run the one test, you should see that
it's already passing. Instead, you just need to follow along with the
instructions and pay attention to how the different parts of the code are
working together to create the desired functionality.

### Identify the Three Essential Pillars of Front-End Web Programming

We've introduced our three essential pillars of front-end web programming:

- Manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM)
- Recognizing JS events
- Communicating with the server

We also described the interaction that we want to make: "favoriting" an item on
social media to turn an empty heart to red. Now, let's pull it all together and
see how it works by walking through some code.

### Cause a Change to Given Code So That DOM Updating Effect Is Seen

Meet our app, Simple Liker! It demos the favoriting action we've talked about
and alerts you to what is happening at each step of the process. When all is
working as it should, the action looks like this:

![working example of favoriting a post][three-pillars-example-working]

Go ahead and open up `index.html` in your browser. To do this, first go to your
terminal and make sure you're in the directory where this README lives. If
you're on a Mac, run `open index.html` and if you're using Windows, run
`explorer.exe index.html`. If that doesn't work, you can open the file directly
from Chrome. Choose `Open file...` from the `File` menu, navigate to the
directory where this README is located, and open the file.

If you try clicking one of the "Like" buttons on the page, your experience will
look something like this:

... which is, nothing happens. That's because we haven't switched on the
working code yet. We're going to go through, step by step, find the code that
makes each step work, and demo it to see how it looks in the browser.

Open up your `demo.js` file and take a look at everything there. Find the
comments that begin with "Step 1." Follow the instructions there to un-comment
the code that locates the page element we want â€” in this case, the heart.

Once you uncomment the line of code and refresh the page, you can use the
console to verify that the articleHearts variable contains a nodeList with five
elements.

### Cause a Change to Given Code So That Server-Side Behavior Is Stubbed in

Next, in your `demo.js` file, find the comments describing Step 2, which sets up
the mock server communication (our third pillar):

Once you've uncommented out the code and refreshed the page, try clicking one of
the "Like" buttons again. You'll see that it's still not working. That's because
we've uncommented the code that mocks our communication with the server, but we
haven't yet told JavaScript to listen for the "click" event.

### Cause a Change to Given Code So That Event Listening Has an Effect

Find Step 3 in the commented code. It's time to bring in the second pillar,
events:

We've activated all the parts of our code that stitch together the three pillars
of front-end web programming. Let's go back to your browser and see what Simple
Liker looks like in action. You should now be able to like and unlike each post.

## Conclusion

We're starting to see how the pieces work together now! Which means we're ready
to dive into the individual pillars and learn more about how each one functions.
We'll start by reviewing how to manipulate the DOM.
