# Challenge: TaskLister Mini-Project
 
## Learning Goals

* Build a functioning to-do list application
* Suppress a default action with `event.preventDefault()`

## Introduction

In this lab, you'll be creating a simple to-do list application that uses
JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.

Check out the [working demo][example]!

## Lab: Build a Functioning To-Do List Application

Instead of relying on tests, this lab is _deliverable driven_. You will be
responsible for ensuring that your solution works as intended by testing the
behavior in the browser.

1. Fork and clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in Chrome
3. Put your JavaScript knowledge to the test and work your way through the
   deliverables

### Structuring Your Code

You've been provided with a basic HTML file, as well as an `index.js` file where
you can implement your solution. Note that the `index.js` file is contained
within a `src` folder â€” this is a common pattern that you will see in many labs
moving forward. If you take a look at the `index.html` file, you'll see that the
`script` tag that loads the code file includes the `src` directory in its path:

```html
<script src="./src/index.js"></script>
```

### Deliverables

* As a user, I should be able to type a task into the input field.
* As a user, I should be able to click some form of a submit button.
* As a user, I expect to see the task string that I provided appear in the DOM
  after the submit button has been activated.

**Note:** [While the example][example] shows one possible working implementation
of the TaskLister app, yours can (and is encouraged to!) look however you like!

### HTML Forms

For this lab, we are going to be using the [HTML `<form>` element][form] to
capture the tasks the user enters. HTML forms can be quite complex and
sophisticated but, at their most basic, consist of opening and closing `<form>`
tags that enclose one or more `<input>` elements where users can enter
information, and a way to submit the form. There are many types of [input
fields][] to choose from; we use the `type` attribute to specify the one we
want. For this lab, we are using two: a text field (`type="text"`) and a submit
button (`type="submit"`).

If you look in the `index.html` file, you will see the following:

```html
    <form id="create-task-form" action="#" method="POST">
      <label for="new-task-description">Task description:</label>
      <input type="text" id="new-task-description" name="new-task-description" placeholder="description">
      <input type="submit" value="Create New Task">
    </form>
```

Now take a look at the page in your browser. The rendered form looks like this:

![TaskLister input form](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-1/javascript-events/task_lister.png)

You can see each of the components that are in our form's HTML:

1. the label for our input field ("Task description:")
2. the input box, with the placeholder content "description", and
3. the button that's created by the `submit` input tag

Let's take a closer look at the opening `<form>` tag. You'll see it includes an
(optional) `id` attribute and two other attributes:

```html
<form id="create-task-form" action="#" method="POST">
```

Because HTML forms were designed to be handled by backend programming languages
such as PHP, the `action` attribute would normally contain a path to the backend
code that processes the data captured from the user. Because we will be handling
the form using JavaScript, we don't need to provide a path. By convention, we
set that attribute to `"#"`.

The `method` attribute specifies the _type_ of action we're executing when the
form is submitted. The `method` attribute's value (in this case, "POST") is an
_HTTP Verb_. (Although it is not required, you will often see HTTP verbs in all
caps.) We will learn more about HTTP Verbs in the next section. For now, just
know that the `POST` method is used when we want to capture the data submitted
by our form and use it in some way.

By default, the HTML `<form>` element submits the form and redirects the browser
to a new url when the `<submit>` button is clicked. This default behavior makes
sense when form submission is being handled by a back-end programming language.
However, this _is not_ the experience we want to build in this lab. We instead
want to handle the submission of the form using JavaScript and update the DOM
without reloading the page. Therefore, we need to prevent that event from
performing its default behavior.

### Suppress a Default Action with `Event.preventDefault()`

The deliverables for this lab require you to use JavaScript to handle the
clicking of the submit button. To do this, you'll need to listen for a `submit`
event on the `<form>` element. In order to _prevent_ the _default_ behavior of
the `submit` event, when our event listener "sees" the event, it needs to invoke
the `preventDefault()` method on it.

Take a look at the [MDN Documentation on `Event.preventDefault()`][mdn-pd].
You'll see how JavaScript is used to prevent a form element (checkbox) from
doing its _default_ behavior (appearing checked upon click). You'll want to
prevent `submit` from doing its default behavior in a similar fashion.

### Stretch Deliverables

Once you've got the required deliverables working, you may want to try to
implement one or more of the following:

* A delete function that will remove tasks from your list
* A priority value selected from a [dropdown][] that is used to determine the color
  of the text in the list (e.g. red for high priority, yellow for medium, green
  for low)
  * As an additional challenge, implement a sorting functionality that displays
    the tasks in ascending or descending order based on priority
* An additional input field (e.g. user, duration, date due)
* Ability to edit tasks
* Something of your choice! The main objective is to add a feature that allows
  the user's input to affect the DOM
