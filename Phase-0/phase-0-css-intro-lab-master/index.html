      <h1 id='main-header'>How Does Writing CSS Differ From Writing HTML?</h1>
      <p>As we write CSS these are the type of questions we might ask ourselves:</p>

      <ul>
        <li class='perspective-questions'>Should the layout of the text be in a single or double column?</li>
        <li class='perspective-questions'>Should we use a different font color for the header?</li>
        <li class='perspective-questions'>How should the same content appear
          differently on a desktop versus a mobile device?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All of the questions above deal with the aesthetic considerations of the page. These are the concerns of the presentation layer (CSS).</p>
      <p>As a contrast, let's consider the type of questions we might ask ourselves as we write HTML:</p>

      <ul>
        <li class='perspective-questions'>Does the order of items within a list matter? Should it be a numbered list?</li>
        <li class='perspective-questions'>Should we wrap a list of links inside a navigation tag?</li>
        <li class='perspective-questions'>Is this the most important header in the whole HTML document?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The last few questions deal with structure, hierarchy, and meaning. These are the concerns of the content layer (HTML).</p>
      <p>When we write CSS, we focus on aesthetic and display considerations. When we write HTML, we focus on structure, hierarchy, and meaning.</p>
