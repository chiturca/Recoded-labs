# A React App Example

## Learning Goals

- Understand the folder structure and key files for running a React application
- Explore the structure of a basic React component
- Debug React components using the React Developer Tools

## Introduction

Before we dive in and start working on specific parts of a React project, let's
take a look at a simple React application so we can understand it at a high
level.

In this lesson, we will start with a basic React app, examine the default
directory structure, and gain a better understanding of how these apps are
built.

## Starting Up a React App

This lesson has all the necessary parts of a fully working React app. First,
make sure you're running a compatible version of Node. You should be using Node
16, since Node 17 has some compatibility issues with several JavaScript
libraries. To check your Node version, run the following, and verify that Node
16.x.x is installed and is the default version (the -> indicates the default):

```console
$ nvm list

->     v16.13.0
        v17.0.1
         system
default -> 16 (-> v16.13.0)
```

If it's not, you can install it and set it as the default with the following
commands:

```console
$ nvm install 16
$ nvm alias default 16
$ nvm use 16
```

Next, make sure to download the source code for this lesson. Use the "Fork" link
at the top of the page to fork and clone this lesson onto your computer. Then
navigate into the lesson's directory and run:

```console
$ npm install
```

This will get and install all the required dependencies for React.

Next, we need to start up a server for the app to run on:

```console
$ npm start
```

This will host the app and open a browser window to display it. If the server
started correctly but the browser doesn't open, you can use the links that
appear in the terminal to access the app. They should look something like this:

```console
Local:            http://localhost:3000
On Your Network:  http://192.168.1.5:3000
```

You can use the `Local` link to open the app in your own browser. The second is
for any _other_ computers on your network that you want to access your app from
(this is particularly useful if you want to test out your app in a mobile
browser on your phone).

If everything has worked correctly, you should see a page with the exact time it
was loaded, along with a small amount of text and a GIF.

If we make any changes to our app while the server is running, it will 'hot
reload,' and update the app in the browser. If there are app-breaking errors in
your code, the browser will display those errors instead.

We'll start by exploring the JavaScript code for this sample app in the `src`
directory.

## index.js

The "entry point" into our application — the first JavaScript code that will run
when our app starts up — is in the `src/index.js` file. Open that file in your
text editor. Inside, you'll see something like this:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./components/App";
import "./index.css";

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

We'll talk about the `import` statements in a bit, but for now, let's have a
look at `ReactDOM.render()`.

This `render` method comes from the `react-dom` package. It takes in two
arguments:

- A **React component** to render (typically, we'll render our top-level `App`
  component here).
- A **DOM element** where we want that component to be rendered (by convention,
  a `div` with the ID of `root`).

`ReactDOM.render()` will always be used in your applications. This one small
function is how the rest of our application — all the components we'll write —
will eventually make its way onto the DOM!

Even though React is a modern, complex framework, it still relies on a regular
`index.html` file to load the JavaScript! The file can be found in the `public`
folder. Take a look at it now. Can you see where the `div` with the ID of `root`
is?

In general, when you're given a React project to work with, it's a good idea to
start by reading the `index.js` file then work your way down from there into the
rest of the components.

## App.js

Next, open up `src/components/App.js` in a text editor. This file contains our
`App` component. Within the `App` component is a section of code that looks
_very much_ like HTML:

```jsx
<div className="App">
  <h1>{format(new Date(), "MMMM do yyyy, h:mm:ss a")}</h1>
  <p className="App-intro">
    In React apps, we write JSX - it looks like HTML, and uses a lot of HTML
    syntax. JSX lets us include JavaScript functions right along with the HTML,
    and also allows us to add in components, which are separate, self-contained
    chunks of JSX.
  </p>
  <ExampleComponent />
</div>
```

There's also some _JavaScript_ code mixed in with this HTML-like syntax:

```js
format(new Date(), "MMMM do yyyy, h:mm:ss a");
```

As it turns out, this is actually _all_ JavaScript. The HTML-like syntax is
called JSX. It lets us write code that looks nearly identical to HTML, but
allows us to mix in vanilla JavaScript and other neat things.

Reading through the JSX code, we've got one `div` that contains three child
elements, `<h1>`, `<p>` and `<ExampleComponent />`. In your browser, _these_ are
the elements being displayed! The `<h1>` provides a timestamp of the exact time
the app was loaded, and the `<p>` section includes the brief text on JSX.

The `ExampleComponent` contains the sunglasses GIF. In the `src` folder, take a
look at `ExampleComponent.js`. You'll see a file very similar to `App.js`,
containing `<img>` and `<p>` elements.

By including `<ExampleComponent />` in `App.js`'s JSX, we are able to use the
contents of the component. If you copy and paste `<ExampleComponent />` so it is
listed two times in a row, _two_ GIFs will appear on the page. Try this now.

What about the rest of `App.js`, though? Moving out from the middle, we see this
JSX code is the _return_ value of a function called `App`:

```js
function App() {

  return (
    // JSX goes here!
  )
}
```

The key thing to understand is that all of the _visible content_ of our app is
returned from this `App` function.

We've already seen that it is possible to have multiple files that contain
visible content, i.e., by using both `App` and `ExampleComponent`.
`ExampleComponent`, however, is used within `App`. `App` is at the top-most
level; it is the _parent component_ of our React app content.

## Importing, Exporting, and the Dependency Tree

There are two other sections in the `App.js` file we haven't touched on: the
`import` and `export` sections at the top and bottom.

```js
import React from "react";
import { format } from "date-fns";
import ExampleComponent from "./ExampleComponent";

function App() {
  // etc
}

export default App;
```

`react` and `date-fns` are both npm packages, so what is happening here?
`App.js` is _pulling in_ specific content from these two packages! `react` and
`date-fns` are being _imported_ from the `node_modules` folder, which was
created when we ran `npm install`.

You can see in the `App` function that `format` from the `date-fns` library is
being used in the return statement when we call `format(...)`.

`react` is also being used, even though you can't see it written in the code!
Anywhere you write JSX inside a component, it is actually _transpiled_ to
JavaScript code that looks like this:
`React.createElement(tagName, props, children)` (more on that later).

> Version 17 of React, released October 2020, introduced a new JSX
> transformation. So instead of `React.createElement()`, the JSX is transpiled
> into `_jsx()`. You can read more about the change [here][jsx].
>
> With React 17, you can actually _omit_ the line `import React from "react"` in
> your component files, and they'll still work just fine. You can find out which
> version of React a project is using by looking at `dependencies` section of
> the `package.json` file. Our lessons typically use React 17 and above, so
> you'll often see the import statement for React has been omitted.

The import for `ExampleComponent` is slightly different. Rather than importing
code from a package, here we are importing something from within our project's
file tree. By importing `./ExampleComponent`, we make `<ExampleComponent />`
available for use in the `App` component's return statement.

OK, then what is happening with `export`? By including the `export` line, we are
allowing _other_ files to _import_ things from the `App.js` file. There are
different types of exports, like named exports and default exports, but we will
dive deeper into this topic in a later lesson.

For now, we will just focus on default exports. The line, `export default App`
denotes that our `App` function is the main thing we want to export from our
`App.js` file. You can have only one default export per file. If you take a look
at `index.js`, you can see at the top of the file that we are _importing_ `App`
from the `App.js` file in the `src/components` directory (the `.js` does not
need to be included). This import statement is what we use to import something
that is the default export of another file:

```js
import App from "./components/App";
```

This structure of importing and exporting allows for files to create a 'tree' of
dependencies. `ExampleComponent.js` has an `export` statement as well (take the
time to locate it), and is imported into `App.js`. Additionally, `App.js` is
imported into `index.js`.

The `index.js` file doesn't have an export. It is the 'top' of this dependency
tree.

## Debugging Components

React has a great set of developer tools that make it easier to view our
components in the browser and debug what's happening under the hood. Install the
React Developer Tools [Chrome Extension][devtools-chrome] or [Firefox
Extension][devtools-firefox]. Here is the [readme][devtools-readme] for the
extension.

After installing, restart your browser, then go to `http://localhost:3000` to
view our React application. Open your browser's developer tools, and find the
**Components** tab. Here, you'll see the component hierarchy with information
about all the components we're using so far in the app!

## Deliverables

There are three tests to pass in this lesson. They are all related to the
content within `src/components/App.js`.

1. Replace the contents of the `h1` element so that, instead of a time, it just
   says 'Now'
2. If you added a second `<ExampleComponent />`, be sure to remove it
3. Add in a _new_ component, `<TestComponent />`, just below
   `<ExampleComponent />`, in the `App.js` file (remember: you will need to
   **import** the component before you can use it)

When working on React labs, it's helpful to have two terminal tabs open:

- In the first tab, run `npm start` to run your React app in the browser
- In the second tab, run `learn test` or `npm test` to see the test output

## Conclusion

There is a lot we still haven't touched on, and we will go into greater depth on
how things work in the following lessons. Almost all of our work, however, will
be done within `App.js` and child components of it. This is where all of our
creative energy will be spent.

This file structure in this lesson is what `create-react-app` automatically
generates, and it's what you'll see in many React projects. Using this
structure, a lot of set-up is abstracted away. We have all the boilerplate code
in place in the `index.html` and `index.js` files so that we can start focusing
on writing the core functionality of our app using components, like in `App.js`.
