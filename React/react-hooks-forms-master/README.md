# Controlled Components

## Learning Goals

- Understand what "controlled components" are in React
- Implement controlled components by synchronizing input values with component
  state

## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll discuss how to set up controlled inputs in React.

If you want to code along, there is starter code in the `src` folder. Make sure
to run `npm install && npm start` to see the code in the browser.

## Controlling Form Values From State

Forms in React are similar to their regular HTML counterparts. The JSX we write
is almost identical. The way we store and handle form data, however, is entirely
new.

In React, it is often a good idea to set up _controlled_ forms. A controlled
form is **a form that derives its input values from state**. Consider the
following:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState("John");
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState("Henry");

  return (
    <form>
      <input type="text" value={firstName} />
      <input type="text" value={lastName} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default Form;
```

With the setup above, the two text `input` elements will display the
corresponding state values.

This code is not quite complete though — as it is now, there is no way to
_change_ the state. The inputs in the form above will be stuck displaying
whatever state is set to.

To completely control a form, we also need our form to _update_ state.

## Updating State via Forms

If we can change state values, React will re-render and our `input`s will
display the new state. We know that `setFirstName` and `setLastName` are what
we'll need to initiate a state change, but when would we use them?

We want to fire it **every time the input value changes**. Forms should display
whatever changes a user makes, even if it is adding a single letter in an input.
For this, we use an event listener, `onChange`, that React has set up for us:

```jsx
<input type="text" onChange={handleFirstNameChange} value={firstName} />
<input type="text" onChange={handleLastNameChange} value={lastName} />
```

We can listen for several types of events on input fields. `onChange` will fire
every time the value of an input changes. In our example, we're passing a
callback function that accepts `event` as its argument. The `event` data being
passed in is automatically provided by the `onChange` event listener. Let's
write out what these functions look like:

```jsx
function handleFirstNameChange(event) {
  setFirstName(event.target.value);
}

function handleLastNameChange(event) {
  setLastName(event.target.value);
}
```

The `event` contains data about the `target`, which is whatever DOM element the
`event` was triggered on. That `target`, being an `input` element, has a `value`
attribute. This attribute is equal to whatever is currently entered into that
particular `input`!

Keep in mind, **this is not the value we provided from state**. When we read
`event.target.value`, we get whatever content is present when the event fired.
In the case of our first input, that would be a combination of whatever
`firstName` is equal to _plus_ **the last key stroke**. If you pressed 's',
`event.target.value` would equal "Johns".

Inside both functions is a function to update state. The two functions are
nearly identical, with just one difference: `setFirstName()` changes the
`firstName`, and `setLastName()` changes the `lastName`. The full component
would look like the following:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState("John");
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState("Henry");

  function handleFirstNameChange(event) {
    setFirstName(event.target.value);
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(event) {
    setLastName(event.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <form>
      <input type="text" onChange={handleFirstNameChange} value={firstName} />
      <input type="text" onChange={handleLastNameChange} value={lastName} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default Form;
```

In the `handleFirstNameChange()` and `handleLastNameChange()` functions, we're
updating state based on `event.target.value`. This, in turn, causes a
re-render... and the cycle completes. The _new_ state values we just set are
used to set the `value` attributes of our two `input`s.

From a **user**'s perspective, the form behaves exactly how we'd expect,
displaying the text that is typed. From **React**'s perspective, we gain control
over form values, giving us the ability to more easily manipulate (or restrict)
what our `inputs`s display, and send form data to other parts of the app or out
onto the internet...

![Diagram of onChange events](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/react/react-forms/Image_21_FlowchartUpdate.png)

Controlling forms makes it more convenient to share form values between
components. Since the form values are stored in state, they are easily passed
down as props or sent upward via a function supplied in props.

## Form Element Types

Form elements include `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, and `<form>` itself.
When we talk about inputs in this lesson, we broadly mean the form elements
(`<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`) and not always specifically just
`<input>`.

To control the value of these inputs, we use a prop specific to that type of
input:

- For `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>`, we use `value`, as we have seen.
- For a checkbox (`<input type="checkbox">`), we use `checked`:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Form() {
  const [newsletter, setNewsletter] = useState(false);

  function handleNewsletterChange(event) {
    // .checked, not .value!
    setNewsletter(event.target.checked);
  }

  return (
    <form>
      <label htmlFor="newsletter">Subscribe to our Newsletter?</label>
      <input
        type="checkbox"
        id="newsletter"
        onChange={handleNewsletterChange}
        {/* checked instead of value */}
        checked={newsletter}
      />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default Form;
```

Each of the input types has an `onChange` event listener, allowing us to update
state when a user interacts with a form. Once that happens, the `value` or
`checked` attribute is then set based on the updated state value. Combining
these two steps is what enables us to set up controlled forms.

## Why Use Controlled Forms When We Do Not Have To

Controlled forms can be very useful for specific purposes — since we can set our
state _elsewhere_ using this setup, it's easy to populate forms from existing
available data.

When we have a controlled form, the state does not need to be stored in the same
component. We could store state in a parent component, instead. To demonstrate
this, we'll need to create a new component. To keep it simple, we'll call this
`ParentComponent`. `ParentComponent` can hold all the functions while `Form`
just handles the display of JSX:

```jsx
// src/components/ParentComponent
import React, { useState } from "react";
import Form from "./Form";

function ParentComponent() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState("John");
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState("Henry");

  function handleFirstNameChange(event) {
    setFirstName(event.target.value);
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(event) {
    setLastName(event.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <Form
      firstName={firstName}
      lastName={lastName}
      handleFirstNameChange={handleFirstNameChange}
      handleLastNameChange={handleLastNameChange}
    />
  );
}

export default ParentComponent;
```

Then `Form` can become:

```jsx
// src/components/Form
import React from "react";

function Form({
  firstName,
  lastName,
  handleFirstNameChange,
  handleLastNameChange,
}) {
  return (
    <form>
      <input type="text" onChange={handleFirstNameChange} value={firstName} />
      <input type="text" onChange={handleLastNameChange} value={lastName} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default Form;
```

Previously, our application was rendering `Form` directly inside `src/index.js`.
Now, however, we've added a component that renders `Form` as a child. Because of
this change, you'll need to update `src/index.js` so that it renders
`ParentComponent` instead of `Form`.

> **Note**: If you're following along in the example files, don't forget to
> update `index.js` to point to `ParentComponent`. If you don't make this

> just be regular HTML input fields — they will not be controlled. To verify
> this, you can log `event.target.value` from inside the `handleFirstNameChange`
> and `handleLastNameChange` functions in `ParentComponent`.

With `ParentComponent`, we've moved all the form logic up one level.

![Diagram of a controlled component using props](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/react/react-forms/Image_22_FlowchartReactProps.png)

Being able to store controlled form data in other components opens some
interesting doors for us. We could, for instance, create another component, a
sibling of `Form`, that displays our form data as soon as a user starts filling
in the form:

```jsx
// src/components/DisplayData
import React from "react";

function DisplayData({ firstName, lastName }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{firstName}</h1>
      <h1>{lastName}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default DisplayData;
```

...and adding it alongside `Form` (also wrapping both in a `div`):

```jsx
// src/components/ParentComponent
import React, { useState } from "react";
import Form from "./Form";
import DisplayData from "./DisplayData";

function ParentComponent() {
  // ...
  return (
    <div>
      <Form
        firstName={firstName}
        lastName={lastName}
        handleFirstNameChange={handleFirstNameChange}
        handleLastNameChange={handleLastNameChange}
      />
      <DisplayData firstName={firstName} lastName={lastName} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now we have a component that reads from the same state we're changing with the
form.

![Diagram of controlled components using props](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/react/react-forms/Image_23_FlowchartControlled.png)

This can be a very useful way to capture user input and utilize it throughout
your application, even if a server is not involved.

The opposite can also be true. Imagine a user profile page with an 'Edit' button
that opens a form for updating user info. When a user clicks that 'Edit' button,
they expect to see a form with their user data pre-populated. This way, they can
easily make small changes without rewriting all their profile info.

Just like we did with `ParentComponent`, this could be achieved by populating a
form with data from props! After all, if we have a React app that is displaying
user information, that information is stored _somewhere_ on the app.

## Controlled Forms for Validation

It might seem a little counterintuitive that we need to be so verbose when
working with forms in React, but this actually opens the door to additional
functionality. For example, let's say we want to write an input that only takes
the numbers `0` through `5`. We can now validate the data the user enters
_before_ we set it on the state, allowing us to block any invalid values:

```jsx
function Form() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  function handleNumberChange(event) {
    const newNumber = parseInt(event.target.value);
    if (newNumber >= 0 && newNumber <= 5) {
      setNumber(newNumber);
    }
  }

  return (
    <form>
      <input type="number" value={number} onChange={handleNumberChange} />
    </form>
  );
}
```

If the input is invalid, we simply avoid updating the state, preventing the
input from updating. We could optionally set another state property (for
example, `isInvalidNumber`). Using that state property, we can show an error in
our component to indicate that the user tried to enter an invalid value:

```jsx
function Form() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);
  const [isInvalidNumber, setIsInvalidNumber] = useState(null);

  function handleNumberChange(event) {
    const newNumber = parseInt(event.target.value);
    if (newNumber >= 0 && newNumber <= 5) {
      setNumber(newNumber);
      setIsInvalidNumber(null);
    } else {
      setIsInvalidNumber(`${newNumber} is not a valid number!`);
    }
  }

  return (
    <form>
      <input type="number" value={number} onChange={handleNumberChange} />
      {isInvalidNumber ? <span style={{ color: "red" }}>{isInvalidNumber}</span> : null}
    </form>
  );
}
```

If we tried to do this using an uncontrolled component, the input would be
entered regardless, since we don't have control over the internal state of the
input. In our `onChange` handler, we'd have to roll the input back to its
previous value, which is pretty tedious!

## Conclusion

Using a controlled component is the preferred way to do things in React — it
allows us to keep _all_ component state in the React state, instead of relying
on the DOM to retrieve the element's value through its internal state.

Using a controlled form, whenever our state changes, the component re-renders,
rendering the input with the new updated value. If we don't update the state,
our input will not update when the user types. In other words, we need to update
our input's state _programmatically_.
