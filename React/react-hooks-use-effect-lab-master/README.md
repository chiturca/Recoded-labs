# React useEffect Lab

## Learning Goals

- Use the `useEffect` hook with the dependencies array
- Use a cleanup function with `useEffect` to stop background processes

## Overview

In the labs for this section, we're going to be building a trivia app! The first
feature we're going to work on is the Question component.

There is some starter code for us to work with. There's a `Question` component
already set up to display the question and a list of possible answers. It's also
hooked up to its parent component, `App`, so that it has access to all the props
it needs.

The feature we're going to build out using `useEffect` is a **countdown timer**,
so that the user has to answer each question within 10 seconds.

## Deliverables

When the `Question` component renders, create a side effect using `useEffect` and
use `setTimeout` to run a callback function after 1 second.

Inside the callback function for `setTimeout`, use the `setTimeRemaining`
function to decrease the amount of time remaining by 1 every 1 second.

When `timeRemaining` hits 0, do the following:

- reset `timeRemaining` back to 10 seconds, so our next question will have a
  fresh timer; and
- call the `onAnswered` callback prop with a value of false
  (`onAnswered(false)`), to trigger some behavior in the App component.

You should _also_ use the **cleanup function** for `useEffect` to clean up after
the timeout function.

Make sure to pay attention to any warning/error messages in the console as a
result of using `useEffect`, and clean them up by providing any necessary
_dependencies_ in the second argument of `useEffect`.

If you're stuck on getting the timer working, or encountering some strange
behavior, make sure to check out the resources below!
