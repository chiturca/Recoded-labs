/* 
Write an abstracted component that can be used in place of InventoryTile AND ShopTile

Consider what the tiles have in common and what they do not: 
- For things that are the same, copy and pasting works just fine! 
- For things that are different, consider how you might make use of props and JSX to have the same component behave differently when rendered by different parents
