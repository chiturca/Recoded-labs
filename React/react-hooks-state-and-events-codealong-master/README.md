# React State and Events Code-along

## Learning Goals

- Use the `useState` hook to create state within a component
- Update state based on events

## Introduction

In this code-along, we'll get some hands-on practice writing components with
state and setting state based on different kinds of events.

## Adding State to a Component

To get some practice adding state to a component, code along with this lesson.
There's some starter code in the `src/components` folder. We'll be adding state
to some existing components and building out some functionality that depends on
state.

As a quick recap:

> State is data that changes over time in your component. State must be
> initialized in a component by calling `useState`. Updating state by calling
> `setState` will cause our components to re-render automatically.

To code along, run `npm install && npm start` to install the dependencies and
get the demo app running.

### Determining When To Add State

For our first component, let's work on a toggle button. It should do the
following:

- The button should say "OFF" when it is first displayed
- When the button is clicked, it should say "ON"
- When the button is clicked again, it should say "OFF"
- etc

Let's talk through the steps and how we might think about building a feature
like this as a React developer.

First, let's decide: do we actually need state for this feature? We need to
determine if the data for this feature is _static_ (doesn't change) or _dynamic_
(does change). If it's dynamic, we'll definitely need state! We should also ask
if this feature could be made using **props** instead of **state**.

Here are some questions from
[Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html#step-3-identify-the-minimal-but-complete-representation-of-ui-state)
that will help us decide if we need state:

- Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isnâ€™t state.
- Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so,
  it isnâ€™t state.
- Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isnâ€™t state.

Since this component isn't being passed any props that will let us display some
new button text, and the button's text is _dynamic_ (it changes), we definitely
need to add state!

Our full checklist looks like this:

- ðŸš« Is it passed as a prop?
- ðŸš« Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component?
- ðŸš« Does it remain unchanged over time?

So it's time to add state! There's some starter code in the `Toggle.js` file. If
you're feeling good about what you learned in the last lesson, give it a shot
now! We'll walk through the steps below.

Ok, hope you were able to get that going! Here's our process for adding state
to build out this feature.

#### 1. Import the `useState` hook

Any time we need state in a component, we need to use the `useState` hook from
React. We can import it like so:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
```

#### 2. Set up the initial state

To create a state variable in our component, we need to call `useState` and
provide an initial value:

```jsx
function Toggle() {
  const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);
  // ... the rest of Toggle component
}
```

Whenever you're using a React hook, it **must** be within a React component.
We're setting the initial state here as `false`, because the button should be
"OFF" when the component first renders.

#### 3. Use the state variable in the component

Now that we have this new variable, it's time to use it! We can use the `isOn`
variable to determine what text to display in the button:

```jsx
<button>{isOn ? "ON" : "OFF"}</button>
```

Here, we're doing some
[conditional rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)
to dynamically determine the button's text _based on our state variable_.

You should now be able to change the initial state in the `useState` function
and see if your button's text displays what you expect. Setting an initial state
of `true` should display "ON", and `false` should display "OFF".

#### 4. Call the setter function to update state

Any time we want to _update_ state, we need to use the _setter function_
returned by calling `useState`. We also need to determine what triggers that
update. In our case it's the button being clicked.

Let's start by adding an `onClick` handler to the button:

```jsx
<button onClick={handleClick}>{isOn ? "ON" : "OFF"}</button>
```

Next, let's set up the `handleClick` callback function, and update state. Here,
we must call the _setter function_ to update our state variable. Trying to
update the variable directly won't have any effect (even if we changed our
variable declaration to `let` instead of `const`):

```jsx
let [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);
function handleClick() {
  // updating state directly is a no-no!
  isOn = !isOn;
}
```

So the way we should update state looks like this:

```jsx
function handleClick() {
  setIsOn((isOn) => !isOn);
}
```

All together, here's our updated component:

```jsx
function Toggle() {
  const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);

  function handleClick() {
    setIsOn((isOn) => !isOn);
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>{isOn ? "ON" : "OFF"}</button>;
}
```

### Adding More Features

With this state variable in place, let's add another feature to our button. When
the button is ON, let's make the background red, like this:

```jsx
<button style={{ background: "red" }}>
```

When it's OFF, it should have a white background.

Let's go through those same questions to determine if we need to add state for
this feature.

- ðŸš« Is it passed as a prop?
- âœ… Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component?
- ðŸš« Does it remain unchanged over time?

In this case, we **can** compute it based on other state in our component, so we
don't need to add any _new_ state for this feature.

We can use that same `isOn` state variable, along with some conditional
rendering, to get the button to display the correct border color:

```jsx
function Toggle() {
  const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);

  function handleClick() {
    setIsOn((isOn) => !isOn);
  }

  const color = isOn ? "red" : "white";

  return (
    <button style={{ background: color }} onClick={handleClick}>
      {isOn ? "ON" : "OFF"}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Thinking like a React developer involves making a lot of decisions about how to
structure your components, particularly when it comes to **props** and
**state**. Now that you've seen the process and some common patterns for working
with state, it's up to you to apply these decisions to your own components
moving forward.
